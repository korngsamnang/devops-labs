# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

## Introduction to Terraform

-   An open-source **infrastructure as code (IaC)** by HashiCorp.
-   Let's you automate and manage:

    -   your infrastructure
    -   your platform
    -   services that run that platform

-   By defining the resources in human-readable **configuration files** that you can:
    -   version control
    -   share with others
    -   reuse across different environments
-   Definition of configuration files is declarative, meaning you describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform figures out how to achieve that state.
