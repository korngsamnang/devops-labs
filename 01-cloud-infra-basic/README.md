# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) & Cloud Computing

## Overview

-   **IaaS**: Provides compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, eliminating the need to manage physical servers.
-   **Cloud Computing**: Delegates infrastructure management, allowing users to rent servers and services over the internet.

### Types of Cloud Services

1. **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service)
2. **SaaS** (Software as a Service)
3. **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)
4. **Serverless**

### Popular IaaS Providers

-   **AWS**: Most powerful but complex.
-   **DigitalOcean**: Easier for beginners.

## Setting Up a Server on DigitalOcean (Droplet)

### Steps to Deploy a Java Application (JAR)

1. **Prerequisite**: Create a DigitalOcean account (free credits available).
2. **Configure SSH Keys**: Enable secure access from your local machine.
3. **Create a Droplet**: Choose Linux Ubuntu distribution.
4. **Open SSH Port (22)**: Configure firewall settings for inbound/outbound traffic.
5. **SSH into Server**: Use the droplet's public IP address.
6. **Install Java**: Required to run Java applications.

## Deploying a Packaged Java Application

1. **Build JAR File**: Package your Java application.
2. **Copy to Remote Server**: Transfer the JAR file to the droplet.
3. **Run the Application**: Execute the JAR on the server.

## Security Best Practices

-   **Avoid Root User**: Create a dedicated `admin` user.
-   **User Isolation**: Create separate users for each application (e.g., `nexus`, `jenkins`).
-   **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to application users.

> **Note**: Cloud platforms have unique configurationsâ€”always follow provider-specific security guidelines.
