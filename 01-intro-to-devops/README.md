# Introduction to DevOps

## Traditional IT Roles in Software Development

### Software Development

-   Programmers write code in languages like Java, Python, JavaScript
-   Implements new features and bug fixes

### Software Testing

-   Tests new features and existing functionality
-   Performed by both developers and dedicated testers
-   Includes both manual and automated testing

### Operations

-   Builds applications
-   Deploys on servers
-   Upgrades existing software
-   Runs software in production

## Challenges Between Development and Operations

### Traditional Separation

| Development Team             | Operations Team               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Focus: Fast feature delivery | Focus: System stability       |
| Uses programming languages   | Uses Linux/command-line tools |
| Works with test frameworks   | Manages monitoring tools      |

### Key Problems

1. **Communication Silos**
    - Different priorities (features vs stability)
    - Different tool knowledge
2. **Manual Processes**
    - Deployment checklists
    - Environment configurations
    - Slow release cycles

## DevOps Solution

### Core Philosophy

-   Bridges development and operations
-   Creates shared language and collaboration
-   Automates manual processes for faster, reliable releases

### DevOps Culture

Observe → Implement → Build → Test → Deploy

### Key Practice Areas

-   Source Code Management
-   Package Management
-   Continuous Integration/Deployment
-   Container Orchestration
-   Infrastructure as Code
-   Cloud Platforms
-   Continuous Monitoring

## The DevOps Engineer Role

### Evolution

-   Originally a way of working
-   Now a dedicated role combining:
    -   Development skills
    -   Operations knowledge
    -   Automation expertise

### Core Responsibilities

-   Implement CI/CD pipelines
-   Automate release processes
-   Manage DevOps toolchain:

| Category       | Tools              |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Source Control | Git                |
| CI/CD          | Jenkins, GitLab    |
| Containers     | Docker, Kubernetes |
| Infrastructure | Terraform, Ansible |
| Cloud          | AWS/Azure/GCP      |
| Monitoring     | Prometheus         |

## DevOps Process Flow

Commit Code → Test → Build → Push → Deploy → Monitor

## Summary

-   DevOps bridges development and operations
-   Focuses on automation and collaboration
-   DevOps Engineer role combines development, operations, and automation
-   Key tools include Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and cloud platforms
-   Process flow: Commit → Test → Build → Push → Deploy → Monitor
